# ReactJS_assignment

Assignment for Movie Portal...

The link for the assignment is ...
https://github.com/bharadwn/ReactJS_assignment.git
movie-client folder has all the client files

The 2 videos are also provided in that assignment folder:
reactJS_MovieApp_testing_small.mp4
ReactJS_Movie_app_persistentDB.mp4

I have created my own backend for this in SpringBoot and MySQL DB...
spring-boot-jsontodb-master.zip_expa..

I had some problems with uploading big and lot of files, so I have removed node_modules for movie client , so you will have to install the node modules.... and the java structure (backend) might be little unstable as I have uploaded in parts...

Also, For the backend/java Spring, you will have to provide the username and password in application.properties.
